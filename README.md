# Build Instructions

The build process is very simple:

1. Clone the repo using `$ git clone https://github.com/cyfrost/gmail-electron`.

2. Install project dependencies by running `$ make env` in project root directory.

3.  Now, to run the app, you can do `$ make run` in the project root directory (or `$ npm run start`).

## Building Distribution Packages

After making your changes, you can simply use any of the below commands to build 64-bit distribution packages.

1. Run `$ make build-rpm` to build `.rpm` packages (for Fedora/CentOS/RHEL/SuSE).
2. Run `$ make build-deb` to build `.deb` packages (for Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives).
3. Run `$ make build-pacman` to build `.pacman` packages (for Arch/Manjaro and derivatives).
4. Run `$ make build-appimage` to build `.AppImage` package (for almost every distro out there).
5. Run `$ make build-win` to build Windows `.exe` files.
6. Run `$ make build-linux` to build both `.DEB` and `.RPM` packages.
7. Run `$ make build-all` to build packages for both Windows and Linux (basically all the above).
